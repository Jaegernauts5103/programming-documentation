## Introduction

In November 2025, Team 5103 adopted **MKDocs** as our primary documentation platform. We chose MKDocs because it simplifies the writing process, reduces the intimidation often associated with documentation, and provides a streamlined, organized workflow for the entire team.

This section of our documentation is designed to:

- Teach current and future members how to use MKDocs effectively  
- Establish long-term, maintainable documentation practices  
- Preserve the team’s knowledge base from season to season  
- Support other FRC teams interested in transitioning to MKDocs  

Whether you're brand new to documentation or refining your workflow, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.
