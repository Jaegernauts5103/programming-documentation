# Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the MECH & Cheese Programming Documentation! This guide was created to serve as a complete reference for both FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) and BEST Robotics programming. Whether you're a new member learning the basics or a returning programmer looking to expand your skills, this documentation is designed to guide you step-by-step through everything we do in our codebase and beyond.

Each section is organized by competition, with clear divisions between FRC and BEST content. We’ll begin with foundational programming concepts and progressively move into more advanced, competition-specific material. Along the way, you’ll find links to official resources, tutorials, and citations for everything we reference so you always know where to learn more.

## Purpose

Our purpose in creating this documentation is simple: to make our team sustainable. By writing everything down and continuously improving our resources, we ensure that future members can pick up where others left off and continue building even greater robots year after year.

## Goals

Looking ahead, our goals include:

- Developing our own FRC API to streamline robot programming
- Expand outreach to help other teams learn from our experiences
- Building a fully self-sustaining programming pipeline within our team

This documentation is a living project — meant to grow, evolve, and improve with every season.
